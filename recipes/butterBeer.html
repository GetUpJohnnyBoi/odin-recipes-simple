                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>There's something so darn Chistmassy about the Harry Potter films, particularly the first few, that I always thought of them as Christmas Movies, even though maybe they're not.  Well I'm kicking off this holiday season with a hot mug of cheer with this 1588 recipe for Butterbeer. I know there's a ton of nonalcoholic recipes out there for Butterbeer and those are fine, but honestly, I think this is more in line with what J.K. Rowling had in mind when she wrote the books. 
                        For starters, the kids need to grow up from Pumpkin Juice to Butterbeer, implying there's something more mature about it. Secondly Europe and the U.K. are a bit more lax in regards legal drinking ages, and I'd imagine wizards even more so.  Thirdly, Butterbeer is an actual real thing, found in a Tudor cookbook from 1588. 
                        Was J.K. Rowling specifically referencing this recipe? I can't say for sure (unless she wants to answer!) but I CAN say that I was shocked to discover that Nicolas Flamel was a real person, who wrote a book on alchemy and the creation of the Philosophers Stone. They have copies of it at the NY Public Libary reference branch, rare books section. So, she wasn't strictly making things up with these books.  So, this Butterbeer as the official Wizards Butterbeer? Maybe.</p>
